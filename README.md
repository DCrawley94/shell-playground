# Shell Playground üê¢

This repo is intended to be a resource for Northcoders mentors interested in shell scripting. It's divided into sections each covering some of the basics.

Once you've tackled all the tasks I encourage you to make up your own scripts, especially if you find yourself regularly doing repetitive tasks that could be automated ü§ñ

Also big thanks to Sam Parry for adding a section on how to create shell scripts with JavaScript! Have a look at the `creating-scripts-with-js`.

**_First thing's first here's a few tools I REALLY recommend using:_**

1. [trash CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trash-cli) - The `rm` command can be pretty dangerous as it permanently removes files. Using this instead will move them to the trash which is much safer and reversible!
2. [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) - Can be used from the command line or by pasting a shell script into their website. They also have a VS-Code extension!

**_And some additional materials that are good for reference:_**

- [explainshell](https://www.explainshell.com/) : If you find a piece of code you don't understand just paste it in here and for a detailed breakdown of what it does.

- [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) : The tldr-pages project is a collection of community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement to traditional man pages.

- [Bash Guide](https://github.com/Idnan/bash-guide) : Tons of bash commands and how to use them!

- [Bash scripting cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/bash) : Exactly what it says on the tin.

- [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) : Guidance for best practices when shell scripting - dense reading but useful if you want to check something specific.
